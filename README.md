Trellis - Trello stats for Winners
==================================

Trello's cool, but it doesn't have any relevant reporting out of the box. That's what the API's are for.

Trellis provides the following:

1. Cycle Time
2. Predicted end date.
3. Statistical process control - how predictable is your process.
4. Nice csv output for Panic Statusboard
